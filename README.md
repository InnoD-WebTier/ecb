# Entomology Club at Berkeley

By [Innovative Design](http://innovativedesign.club)

### Overview
This is the website for the Berkeley Student Journal of Asian Studies. This is a guide to managing the website. We use the static site generator [Gatsby.js](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby). If you're curious about what a static site generator is, you can read more [here](https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators). You should be familiar with Git, Github, and the basics of HTML, CSS, and JAvascript in order to maintain this website. We recommend using either a Macbook or a Linux-based OS to do this work.
